anti-emulator
=============

Android Anti-Emulator, originally presented at HitCon 2013: "Dex Education 201: Anti-Emulation"

Purpose of this project was intended to show various was of detecting an emulated Android environment. Some of the methods are adapted from previously seen malware on other operating systems, others are just random thoughts. Slowly over time things have been added that I've either thought of randomly, stumbled upon or came across in the wild. I'll do my best to comment if anything from the wild is added directly to the project, as this would likely be more interesting to AV/researchers attempting to hide their own sandboxes.
